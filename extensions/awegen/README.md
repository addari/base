# awegen

awegen is a code generator for Yii framework.  
awegen borrows goodies from giix and gtc.

## What It Does?

1. Generates textarea for `text` db type
2. Genearates textarea with markitp editor for `longtext` db type
(Uses redactor)
3. Generates checkbox for `boolean` db types
4. Uses JToggleColumn for `boolean` types in Admin/CGridView
(Uses [JToggleColumn extension](http://www.yiiframework.com/extension/jtogglecolumn/))
5. Generates fields with Datepicker for `date` db type
6. Generates fields with Datetimepicker for `time`, `datetime` and `timestamp` db type
(Uses [datetimepicker widget](http://www.yiiframework.com/extension/datetimepicker/))
7. Allows easy addition of access control templates in the generator  
( Users can add templates into `AweCrud/templates/default/auth` folder and they will be listed in the CRUD generator)
8. Guesses e-mail fields by field names and adds e-mail validation for forms and mailto links for views
9. Guesses image fields by field names and tries to display the image in views
10. Guesses url fields by field names and adds url validation for forms and creates links for views
11. Guesses password fields by field names, generates password fields for them in forms and hides them from non-admin users in views
12. Guesses createtime and updatetime fields and adds proper timestamp behaviour to them
13. Uses [Activerecord-relation-behavior](http://yiiext.github.com/extensions/activerecord-relation-behavior/index.html) to handle all kinds of relations
14. Creates pulldown menu for one-to-many and one-to-one relations
15. Creates checkboxes for fields with many-to-many relations
16. Keeps generated code in abstract base model so that regeneration doesn't overwrite user changes
17. Guesses identification column for models and uses them in headings and breadcrumbs  
(Looks for following fields in the order of priority - name, title, slug, any field  with `name` in its name, first non-numeric field, primary key)
18. Handles parent-child relationship of items among same model
(Allows an item to be parent/child of any other items from the same table but not itself)
